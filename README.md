# Linear-Regression-Implementation
A simple Implementation of linear regression in order to predict outcomes of a future event using past history of olympic results data taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results)

What we're trying to predict is the number of medals a country would get based off of the amount of medals that country got in previous years. The teams.csv file will be properly prepped into an 80, 20 split 

80 for training
20 for testing



implementation was done on jupyter notebook for better line by line execution and output provision
if you already have python installed, run
' pip install notebook ' 
in cmd and then run 
'python -m notebook ' to open it


if you don't have python installed, install it first and then follow with the above steps.
Currently working on a full python version.
This was useful in understanding the concept and the steps necessary to properly prep the data
